## 新西兰移民体检要求

## Getting an x-ray or medical examination
## 照X光或体检

> If you need to get a chest x-ray or medical examination, you'll need to bring certain things along to your appointment. At your appointment the physician will examine you and send us information we can use to check you have an acceptable standard of health.
>如果您需要做胸部x光或体检的话，您将需要携带一些东西来赴约。赴约时，内科医生将为您做检查并将检查的信息发送给我们，我们能以此来检查您的健康达标情况。

If you have to get a chest x-ray or medical examination, you’ll need to use a doctor or radiologist from our 'List of Panel Physicians'.
如果您必须要做胸部x光或体检的话，您将需要看我们“指定医生列表”上的一位医生或放射科医生。

If there aren’t any Panel Physicians in your country, you can arrange to have a chest x-ray or medical examination with any registered doctor.
如果在您的国家没有任何指定医生，您可以安排任何注册医生为您做胸部x光或体检。

### When to have your x-ray or medical examination
### 何时照X光或体检

The chest x-ray and medical certificates that doctors send us to confirm you’ve had your x-ray and/or medical examination must be no more than 3 months old when we receive them. For this reason, we recommend you arrange any medical appointments as soon as you can before applying for a visa.
我们必须在3个月内收到医生发送给我们的胸部x光片和诊断书以便确认您已经照过X光和/或做过体检。出于这个原因，我们建议您在申请签证之前尽快安排任何医疗预约。

### What to bring to your appointment
### 体检赴约时，您需带上

- an identity document
-一份身份证件
- your glasses or contact lenses if you use them
-如果您经常戴眼镜或者隐形眼镜的话，带上
- a list of any medication you are taking (including dosage)
-您正在服用的任何药物清单（包括剂量）

### If you’re from an eMedical country

You’ll need to read a copy of the ‘eMedical consent and declaration’ before your examination. During your examination you’ll be asked to confirm that you understand it and then sign it in front of your physician - if you’re aged 17 years or under, your parent or guardian will need to sign it for you.
在做检查前，您需要阅读一份“电子医疗同意与声明”副本。检查期间，医生会询问您是否理解其内容并在医生面前进行签署——如果您17岁或不满17岁，您的父亲（母亲）或监护人需要代您签署。

After your eMedical examination, you’ll be given an eMedical reference number to include with your visa application.

### What happens at a medical examination

3.如果需要的话，做胸部x光。

The physician will complete the physical examination. He or she will check your height, weight, mental state, hearing and vision, listen to your heart, lungs, feel your abdomen and check your reflexes, power and the rest of your nervous system.
医生将完成体检。他/她将会测量您的身高、体重，检查您的精神状态、听力与视力，心率（心律）、肺部听诊，腹部触诊并检查您的反应能力、力量以及其他的神经系统。

You’ll need to remove some items of clothing for the physical examination. Some parts of the physical examination may be completed by a nurse or health care assistant.

如果您想要一份体检结果，您应该在做检查的时候与诊所进行协商。

### Women

You can’t have your medical examination during your period (menstruation) because the blood can affect your results – you’ll need to wait until your period finishes before having your medical examination.
由于血液会影响您的测试结果，所以月经期间您不能进行体检——您需要等到月经结束后再做体检。

Women aged 45 and over may need to have a breast examination. Your physician will tell you if you need one.
