Medical eligibility is a requirement of INA Sections 212(a) and 221(d). Failure to provide required information may cause delay or denial of immigrant visas. If an immigrant visa is not issued, all medical eligibility forms will be treated as confidential under INA Section 222(f).

#### What should the applicant expect at the medical examination?
#### 在健康检查时申请人应该做些什么？

The applicant must show his/her passport (or other photo identification) and appointment letter to the doctor during the medical examination.
在健康检查期间，申请人应该向指定医生出具他或她的护照（或其他带照片的有效证件）和委派信。

The medical examination will include a medical history review, physical examination, chest X-ray and blood tests for syphilis.
健康检查包括病史、体检、胸透 以及针对梅毒的血液检查。

The physical examination will at least include examination of the eyes, ears, nose and throat, extremities, heart, lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, skin and external genitalia.
体检至少包括对眼、耳、鼻、喉、四肢、心脏、肺、腹部、淋巴结、皮肤和外生殖器的检查。

In some countries, the panel physician will send the results to the U.S. Embassy/Consulate directly. In other countries, the panel physician will give the applicant his/her medical exam results in a sealed envelope and an x-ray which the applicant must bring to the interview. 
在一些国家,医生组将会把检查结果直接递交到美国大使馆/领事馆。在其他国家,医生组会把检查结果和X光片以密封的形式交给他/她，这些东西在申请人面谈的时候都要带着。

**Note:** The medical examination is not a complete physical examination. Its purpose is to screen for certain medical conditions relevant to U.S. immigration law. The panel physician is not required to examine you for any conditions except those the U.S. Public Health Service specifies for U.S. immigration purposes, nor is the physician required to provide you with diagnosis or treatment even though other matters related to your health might be discovered. This examination is not a substitute for a full physical examination, consultation, diagnosis, or treatment by your primary health care provider.
“备注”：健康检查并非一套完整的体检。其目的是根据美国的移民法对某些疾病进行筛查。 除了出于移民目，美国公共卫生署指定的检查,不会要求医生组对你进行别的检查，即使其间可能会发现你的其他健康相关问题，但也不会要求医生给你进行诊断和治疗。这一检查不能替代你原来的医疗保健机构向你提供的包括体检、咨询、诊断、或治疗的一套全面体检。 

### Medical Conditions/History

#### What if the applicant had a positive tuberculosis skin test?
#### 经皮试检测出申请人肺结核阳性怎么办？

Applicants with a previous positive skin test for tuberculosis should provide a certificate from the attending doctor (giving the circumstances of the positive test result, and indicating any treatment prescribed, and its duration) to the panel physician. If the applicant has ever been diagnosed with tuberculosis, the applicant must present a written certification, signed by the attending doctor, proving that the applicant was adequately treated. The certificate must include dates and types of medications taken. Applicants who ever had an abnormal chest X-ray should borrow the last X-ray films taken and bring them to the panel physician. The actual films, not the typed reports, may be required to compare with the X-rays that will be taken at the medical examination.
当皮试检测出申请人肺结核阳性时，申请人应该向医生组提供由主治医师开具的证明（带有阳性测试结果的情况，任何形式的处方治疗以及治疗时间)。如果申请人曾经被诊断为患肺结核,申请人必须提交一份由主治医师签字的书面认证,以此证明申请人接受了充分的治疗。书面认证必须包括用药的日期和药物类型。曾经胸透检查异常的申请人要向医生组提交一份近期的X光片。是的X光片的底片，而非打印的报告,这个光片可能要与健康检查时的X光片做比较。

Pregnant women will have to provide the panel physician with consent to conduct the chest x-ray. For the health of the applicant and her unborn child, CDC instructs panel physicians and laboratories to provide abdominal and pelvic protection with double layer, wrap-around lead shields when they receive the chest radiographs. 
美国疾病控制和预防中心(CDC)根据签证签发的相关规定，要求妊娠妇女、被要求做健康检查的女性以及来自目前使用2007年制定的肺结核技术检测指导的国家的女性申请人，都必须做胸透检查。 妊娠妇女也不得不同意医生组为其做胸透检查。但为了申请人及其腹中孩子的健康，美国疾病控制和预防中心规定医生和实验室在检查时要向被检查者的腹部和盆腔提供双层保护，使她们在接受胸部X光检查时得到全方位的保护。
